## 🎮 Game Rules Implemented
* **Dealer Rule:** Total bids cannot equal the number of cards in the round (forcing someone to "go set").
* **Scoring:** 10 points for making a bid + 1 point per trick. Only trick points are awarded if the bid is missed.
* **Tournament Logic:** Automatic calculation of rankings, T-Points, and financial penalties based on score thresholds.

## 💰 Financial Statistics & Penalties
The app tracks financial contributions to the "Pot" based on game performance. All values are calculated automatically upon game finalization:  
1. Money from Losses
   Cost: $1.00 per game.
   Trigger: This penalty is applied only to the player who finishes in last place (the lowest total score) for that specific game.
2. Money from Penalties (The "Threshold" Rule)
   Cost: $1.00 per penalty occurrence.
   Trigger: This is a performance penalty applied if a player's total game score falls below the Tournament Threshold.
   The Math: The threshold is dynamic based on player count: 170 - (10 x number of players). Player owes $1 for each increment of 10 below the threshold.
   Example: In a 5-player game, the threshold is 120. Any player finishing with a score lower than 120 owes $1, lower than 110 owes $2, etc.
